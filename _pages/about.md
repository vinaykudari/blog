I'm Vinay Kudari, currently pursuing MSc in Computer Science at [SUNY Buffalo University](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/graduate/degrees-and-programs/ms-in-computer-science-and-engineering.html). I'm very enthusiastic to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. 

Previously, I was a Software Developer at [Brave Orbit](braveorbit.io) saw it grow from team of 3 to 20. Before that I worked as a Big Data Analyst at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en/services/data-analytics-index)

I graduated from [National Institute of Technology, Durgapur](http://nitdgp.ac.in/) with B.Tech in Computer Science where I worked on thesis by title Gender Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks supervised by [Dakshina Ranjan Kisku](https://nitdgp.ac.in/department/computer-science-engineering/faculty-1/dakshina-ranjan-kisku). I also spent good amount of time in designing flyers/posters for college festivals.
